# psi-continuum-experiments

This repository collects macroscopic experiments illustrating the
Psi-Continuum response framework.

The goal is to demonstrate how apparent acceleration-like or anomalous
behavior can emerge in real physical systems as a global response,
driven by geometry, phase shifts, dissipation, and system memory —
without introducing new forces or microscopic dynamics.

Each experiment is based on real observational data and is designed as
a reproducible, minimal pipeline:
raw data → reference response → diagnostic field Ψ → state-space analysis.

The repository is complementary to the Psi-Continuum cosmology releases
and serves as a laboratory for testing the universality of the response
and state-space description across different macroscopic systems.

The first experiment focuses on tidal dynamics as a clean and physically
transparent proof of concept.
